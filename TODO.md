# Gamification Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding gamification features (leaderboard, streaks, and achievements) to the LMS platform.

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. Create New Schemas
- [x] Create `user_stats` schema
  - [x] Track total points, rank, lessons completed, etc.
  - [x] Add indexes for efficient querying
  
- [x] Create `streaks` schema
  - [x] Track current streak, longest streak, last activity date
  - [x] Add indexes for user lookups
  
- [x] Create `achievements` schema
  - [x] Define achievement types, thresholds, and point values
  - [x] Add descriptions and icon URLs
  
- [x] Create `user_achievements` schema
  - [x] Track which achievements users have earned
  - [x] Add notification status
  
- [x] Create `activity_log` schema
  - [x] Track user activities for streak calculations
  - [x] Define activity types and point values

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Core Services
- [x] Create `StatsService` for managing user statistics
  - [x] Methods for updating stats based on user activity
  - [x] Methods for calculating ranks and leaderboards
  
- [x] Create `StreakService` for managing user streaks
  - [x] Daily streak calculation logic
  - [x] Streak reset logic
  
- [x] Create `AchievementService` for managing achievements
  - [x] Achievement checking logic
  - [x] Achievement awarding logic
  
- [x] Create `ActivityService` for logging user activities
  - [x] Activity point calculation
  - [x] Activity type categorization

### 2. API Endpoints
- [x] Implement leaderboard endpoints
  - [x] Global leaderboard
  - [x] Weekly leaderboard
  - [x] Monthly leaderboard
  - [x] Course-specific leaderboard
  
- [x] Implement user stats endpoints
  - [x] Get user statistics
  - [x] Get user achievements
  - [x] Get user streak information
  
- [x] Implement achievement endpoints
  - [x] List all available achievements
  - [x] Get achievement details

### 3. Integration with Existing System
- [x] Update lesson completion handlers to award points and log activity
- [x] Update course completion handlers to award points and check achievements
- [x] Add login tracking for streak calculations
- [x] Modify existing progress tracking to update user stats

### 4. Background Jobs
- [ ] Create weekly points reset job
- [ ] Create monthly points reset job
- [ ] Create daily streak check job
- [ ] Create leaderboard calculation job

## Testing
- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Test `StatsService` functionality
  - [ ] Test `StreakService` streak calculation logic
  - [ ] Test `AchievementService` achievement checking and awarding
  - [ ] Test `ActivityService` point calculation and logging
  
- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] Test database transactions and data integrity
  - [ ] Test service interactions (e.g., activity logging triggering streak updates)
  - [ ] Test API endpoints with various scenarios
  
- [ ] Performance Tests
  - [ ] Test leaderboard calculation with large datasets
  - [ ] Test batch operations (streak checks, achievement checks)
  - [ ] Test concurrent user activity logging

## Frontend Integration (Future Phase)
- [ ] Design UI components for leaderboard
- [ ] Design UI components for user profile with achievements
- [ ] Design UI components for streak display
- [ ] Implement achievement notification system

## Documentation
- [ ] Document new database schemas
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide for gamification features
- [ ] Update developer documentation

## Point System Definition
- [x] Define point values for activities:
  - [x] Completing lessons: 10-50 points
  - [x] Completing courses: 100-500 points
  - [x] Maintaining streaks: 5 points per day
  - [x] Earning achievements: Variable points

## Achievement Definitions
- [ ] Define course completion achievements (complete 1, 5, 10 courses)
- [ ] Define lesson completion achievements (complete 10, 50, 100 lessons)
- [ ] Define streak achievements (7-day, 30-day, 100-day streaks)
- [ ] Define special achievements (perfect course completion, speed learning)

## Deployment
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Deploy updated services
- [ ] Monitor performance and user engagement
- [ ] Collect feedback for future improvements
