# Gamification Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding gamification features (leaderboard, streaks, and achievements) to the LMS platform.

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. Create New Schemas
- [ ] Create `user_stats` schema
  - [ ] Track total points, rank, lessons completed, etc.
  - [ ] Add indexes for efficient querying
  
- [ ] Create `streaks` schema
  - [ ] Track current streak, longest streak, last activity date
  - [ ] Add indexes for user lookups
  
- [ ] Create `achievements` schema
  - [ ] Define achievement types, thresholds, and point values
  - [ ] Add descriptions and icon URLs
  
- [ ] Create `user_achievements` schema
  - [ ] Track which achievements users have earned
  - [ ] Add notification status
  
- [ ] Create `activity_log` schema
  - [ ] Track user activities for streak calculations
  - [ ] Define activity types and point values

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Core Services
- [ ] Create `StatsService` for managing user statistics
  - [ ] Methods for updating stats based on user activity
  - [ ] Methods for calculating ranks and leaderboards
  
- [ ] Create `StreakService` for managing user streaks
  - [ ] Daily streak calculation logic
  - [ ] Streak reset logic
  
- [ ] Create `AchievementService` for managing achievements
  - [ ] Achievement checking logic
  - [ ] Achievement awarding logic
  
- [ ] Create `ActivityService` for logging user activities
  - [ ] Activity point calculation
  - [ ] Activity type categorization

### 2. API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement leaderboard endpoints
  - [ ] Global leaderboard
  - [ ] Weekly leaderboard
  - [ ] Monthly leaderboard
  - [ ] Course-specific leaderboard
  
- [ ] Implement user stats endpoints
  - [ ] Get user statistics
  - [ ] Get user achievements
  - [ ] Get user streak information
  
- [ ] Implement achievement endpoints
  - [ ] List all available achievements
  - [ ] Get achievement details

### 3. Integration with Existing System
- [ ] Update lesson completion handlers to award points and log activity
- [ ] Update course completion handlers to award points and check achievements
- [ ] Add login tracking for streak calculations
- [ ] Modify existing progress tracking to update user stats

### 4. Background Jobs
- [ ] Create weekly points reset job
- [ ] Create monthly points reset job
- [ ] Create daily streak check job
- [ ] Create leaderboard calculation job

## Frontend Integration (Future Phase)
- [ ] Design UI components for leaderboard
- [ ] Design UI components for user profile with achievements
- [ ] Design UI components for streak display
- [ ] Implement achievement notification system

## Documentation
- [ ] Document new database schemas
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide for gamification features
- [ ] Update developer documentation

## Point System Definition
- [ ] Define point values for activities:
  - [ ] Completing lessons: 10-50 points
  - [ ] Completing courses: 100-500 points
  - [ ] Maintaining streaks: 5 points per day
  - [ ] Earning achievements: Variable points

## Achievement Definitions
- [ ] Define course completion achievements (complete 1, 5, 10 courses)
- [ ] Define lesson completion achievements (complete 10, 50, 100 lessons)
- [ ] Define streak achievements (7-day, 30-day, 100-day streaks)
- [ ] Define special achievements (perfect course completion, speed learning)

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequent queries
- [ ] Implement caching for leaderboard data
- [ ] Optimize batch updates for user stats
- [ ] Monitor database performance after deployment
